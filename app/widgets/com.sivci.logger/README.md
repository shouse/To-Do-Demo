## Description
**sh.logger** is a full featured logging library / widget for Titanium.

## Installation
Clone or download this and build using standard Titanium build practices.

## Usage
I always initialize this in alloy.js

```javascript
// Logging utility and expose it to the global namespace
var LogObject = require('logging/logging');
var log = new LogObject.Logger();
log.init();

Alloy.Globals.log = log;
```
## Configuration
Open the app's config.js file and add the following:
```javascript
"logger": {
  "enabled": true,              // Enabled or not?  Disable at runtime for more capabilities
  "remoteProvider": "acs",      // Want to store your logs to a remote provider?  Plugins needed and slight re-arch
  "remoteLevel": "E",           // What threshold level should logs be sent?
  "fileLevel": "D",             // What threshold level should logs be sent to filesytem?
  "crittercism": false,         // Use Crittercism?  Why not?  Configure crittercism integration here
  "crittercismIOSAppId": "[YOUR-IOS-APP-ID]",
  "crittercismAndroidAppId": "[YOUR-ANDROID-APP-ID]"
}
```
